# Flutter Build: Maximum Logging

When running Flutter build commands (flutter build), always use maximum logging by adding --verbose flag to see detailed build process information.

**Usage Examples:**
- `flutter build apk` → `flutter build apk --verbose`
- `flutter build ios` → `flutter build ios --verbose`
- `flutter build web` → `flutter build web --verbose`

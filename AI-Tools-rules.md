## AI Tools Output Visibility

- **Mandate:** All tool outputs, including `web_fetch`, `read_file`, `read_many_files`, `list_directory`, `run_shell_command`, and any other executed tools, must be displayed in their entirety.
- **Purpose:** This ensures full transparency and provides the user with complete context for debugging, verification, and understanding the agent's operations. No output should be truncated or summarized unless explicitly requested by the user for a specific instance.

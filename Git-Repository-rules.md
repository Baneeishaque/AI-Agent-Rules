# Git Repository Creation: Standard Structure and Documentation

When creating new git repositories, use hyphenated folder names (e.g., Sample-Repo, My-Project-Name) unless explicitly stated otherwise (some tools like Dart packages may require different naming strategies). Always create repositories in ~/sample/path/ directory unless specified otherwise. When creating a repository, automatically generate a comprehensive README.md file following GitHub standards with maximum details about the repository/project, and commit it with a proper conventional commit message.

**Naming Convention:**
- Default: Hyphenated-Names (e.g., Sample-Repo, Flutter-Todo-App)
- Location: ~/sample/path/Project-Name/
- Exceptions: Tool-specific requirements (e.g., Dart packages may need underscores)

**Auto-Generated Files:**
- README.md with GitHub standards and comprehensive project details
- Initial commit with proper conventional commit message

**Examples:**
- ~/sample/path/React-Component-Library/
- ~/sample/path/API-Documentation-Tool/
- ~/sample/path/Flutter-Mobile-App/

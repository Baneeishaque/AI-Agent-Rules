# Git Repository: Auto-index Codebases

When the user's current working directory (pwd) is within a git repository, automatically treat it as an indexed codebase for search_codebase tool usage, even if not explicitly listed in the codebases configuration.

**Benefits:**
- Automatic codebase search capability when navigating to any git repo
- No need to manually configure codebase indexing for each project

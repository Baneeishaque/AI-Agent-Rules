# Git Operation Rules


## Version Control Operations

### 1. Commits
- **Explicit Request Required**: Do NOT generate commit messages or execute `git commit` unless the user **explicitly** requests it.
- **No Auto-Commits**: Never assume a task completion implies a commit. Always wait for instruction.
- **Commit Messages**: When authorized, must strictly follow `Git-Commit-Message-rules.md`.

### 2. Pushes
- **Explicit Request Required**: Do NOT execute `git push` unless the user **explicitly** requests it.
- **No Auto-Pushes**: Even if a commit is requested, do not chain a push command unless specifically told to "commit and push".
